**Scrutiny is a Hard Drive Health Dashboard & Monitoring solution, merging manufacturer provided S.M.A.R.T metrics with real-world failure rates.**

> NOTE: Scrutiny is a Work-in-Progress and still has some rough edges.

### Features

Scrutiny is a simple but focused application, with a couple of core features:

- Web UI Dashboard - focused on Critical metrics
- `smartd` integration (no re-inventing the wheel)
- Auto-detection of all connected hard-drives
- S.M.A.R.T metric tracking for historical trends
- Customized thresholds using real world failure rates
- Temperature tracking
- Provided as an all-in-one Docker image (but can be installed manually)
- Configurable Alerting/Notifications via Webhooks
- (Future) Hard Drive performance testing & tracking
